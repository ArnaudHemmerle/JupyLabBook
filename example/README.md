Here you can find an example of JupyLabBook ran at its version 2.0

You can simply look at the pdf file to see what a typical output looks like, or at the html file to see the code as well.

To test the notebook by yourself:
- First untar the archive recording.tar.gz in place (it contains the nexus files),
- Run Example.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
